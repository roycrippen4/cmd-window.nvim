Goals:

Must have:

1. Show full history of commands in a float, cursor starts on a newline below most recent command.
2. Execute the line the cursor is on via `<CR>`
3. Replace the builtin command-line-window with a floating window.
4. Possiblly use this as a replacement for the commandline entirely.

Nice to have:

1. Possibly add some form of highlighting to the text in the window.
2. Implementation for searches via `?` and `/`
